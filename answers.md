What's Git?
A git is British slang for "unpleasant person," which Torvalds, the creator of Linux and Git, used to maintain his "egotistical" nature in naming his projects.

Git is a popular version control system used in software development. Most version control systems keep track of the files and what changes they have over time; Git, however, keeps track of the states of the files instead - snapshots, rather than the complete track of changes for speed.

What's Github?
GitHub is built on Git - it's become somewhat a "Dropbox for coders" as it provides hosting services that are built on Git, which is useful for code repositories (especially when there is collaborative coding involved, which can get messy). It also doubles as a social networking site for coders, because not only are users' projects, repositories, and contributions posted there, but they can also easily contribute to other projects that are hosted online.
